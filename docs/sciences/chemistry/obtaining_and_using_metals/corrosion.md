# Corrosion

- Corrosion - natural process where a metal reacts with oxygen in the air forming oxides and overtime, the metal is destroyed

## Rust Experiment

- Test tube that contains nails only
- Test tube that contains nails and water
- Test tube that contains nails and a dessicant, e.g., calcium chloride
- Test tube that contains nails submerged in boiled water covered with a layer of oil

## Corrosion Prevention

- Removing oxygen/water
- Electroplating - coated in a thin layer of another metal, chemical way
- Galvanisation - coated in a thin layer of another metal, physical and chemical barrier
