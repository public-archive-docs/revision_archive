## Typical properties of transition metals

### Chemical

- Compounds of transition metals are usually coloured
- Most of them can show more than one valency
- Transition metals and their compounds can be catalysts

### Physical

- Tend to have higher densities than many other metals
- Tend to be harder and tougher than many other metals
- Especially have good electrical conductivites
- Tend to have higher melting/boiling points than many other metals

## Sodium hydroxide to iron (II) chloride and iron (III) chloride

- A green solid appears as soon as the sodium hydroxide is added to the iron(II) chloride solution
- After about 10 seconds, an orange/brown layer forms on the surface of the solution
- The orange/brown layer darkens the longer its left
