# Recycling and Life Cycle Assesment

## Why should we recycle

- Requires less energy than making new
- Preserves resources for the future
- Prevents material going into landfills
- Cheaper than making new

### Problems

- Requires infrastructure to collect and sort materials

## 4 main stages of the LCA

### Raw Materials

- Raw materials come from the Earth's crust/atmosphere or oceans
- Obtaining these materials has an impact of the enviroment:
	- Using up limited resources such as ores and crude oil
	- Damaging habitats through quarrying, mining or felling trees

### Manufacture

- Manufacture of products has an impact on the enviroment including:
	- Land for factories
	- Use of machines and people

### Use

- Impact of a product on the enviroment during its use, depends on type of product
	- Chair wouldn't have a significant impact
	- A car would though

### Disposal

- Disposal of old products has an impact on the enviroment including:
	- Land for landfill sites
	- Whether the product can be recycled/reused
