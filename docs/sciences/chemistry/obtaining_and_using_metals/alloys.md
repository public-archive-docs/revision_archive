## What are alloys?

- An alloy is a mixture of two or more elements
- One element in the mixture must be a metallic element
- Many alloys contain only metallic elements
- An example of an alloy is bronze, a mixture of copper and tin

## Properties of Alloys

- Better corrosion resistance
- Harder
- Stronger
- Worse thermal conductivity - think of Bunsen burners
- Worse electrical conductivity
