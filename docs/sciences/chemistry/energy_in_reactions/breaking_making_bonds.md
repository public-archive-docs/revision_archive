# Breaking and Making Bonds

- Breaking - costs more energy to break, takes in energy from the surroundings, [endothermic](./endothermic_reactions.md)
- Making - costs less energy to make, gives out energy to the surroundings as thermal, [exothermic](./exothermic_reactions.md)

## Formula

- Change in energy = breaking - making
