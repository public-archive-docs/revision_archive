# Fertilisers and Making Ammonium Salts

## Application of Ammonia

- Global market size is estimated to be worth over Â£150 million with roughly 200 million tonnes produced yearly
- Ammonia is produced in the Haber process and an important feedstock to produce:
	- Explosives
	- Polymers
	- Dyes
	- Cleaning products
	- Fertilisers


## Fertilisers

- Improve growth of crop plants
- Can be natural (manure) or artifical with syntheic mixtures of soluble chemicals added to the soil
- Fertilisers containing nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium are very common as these elements promote plant growth
- Known as NPK fertilisers
<br/><br/>
- Fertilisers replace minerals used up by plants and help prevent deficiency diseases
- Farmers use fertilisers to not only increase crop yields but keep yields at consistent level each year

### NPK

#### 3 elements needed by plants to promote growth

- Nitrogen
- Phosphorus
- Potassium

#### What are NPK fertilisers

- Fertilisers containing:
	- Nitrogen
	- Phosphorus
	- Potassium

#### Why must the compounds found in fertilisers be soluble in water

- Can dissolve into soil and be absorbed by the root hair cells

#### What ions are sources for nitrogen

- Ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrates (NO<sub>3</sub>)

#### What ions are sources for phosphorus

- Phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub>)

#### What ions are sources for potassium

- Simple potassium ions (K<sup>+</sup>)

#### Examples of fertilisers

- Ammonia nitrate
- Ammonia sulfate
- Ammonia phosphate
- Potassium Nitrate
- Urea

### Problems

- Eutrophication occurs when excessive fertilisers run off into water, leading to nutrient overload
	- Promotes algal blooms that deplete oxygenin water, harming aquatic life and disrupting ecosystems
- Preventing this involves managing fertiliser application and implementing buffer zones near water bodies to reduce runoff

#### Buffer zone

- Vegetated area near water bodies that help absorb nutrients, filter pollutants and reduce runoff
	- Thus protecting the water quality


## Applications of ammonium salts

- Plays a role in water purification by removing unwanted ions and contaminants
- Handling and storage of ammonium salts must be done with care to prevent hazards such as explosions, particularly with ammonium nitrate


## Production of ammonium salts

- Chemists first devise ways to make chemicals synthetically in a lab before mass production
- Ammonium salts can be produced in lab:
	- React an acid with ammonia (titration)
	- Evaporating solution and collecting crystals of ammonium salts
	- Known as batch process
<br/><br/>
- After a synthesis route has been devised in the lab, this is then scaled up and optimised to be used with industrial processing
- Typically increases efficiency of the process
- In industy:
	- Ammonia and sulphuric acid will be made on site
- Production of ammonium salts is a continuous process
