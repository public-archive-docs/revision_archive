# Changing Conditions

## La Chatellier's Principle

- Position of equilibrium will move to oppose any change in conditions

## Change in Conditions

### Temperature increases

#### Position of equilibrium

- Moves in direction of the endothermic reaction

#### Time taken to reach equilibrium

- Decreases

### Pressure increased in a reaction involving gases

#### Position of equilibrium

- Moves to the side of the balanced equation with fewer molecules of reacting gas

#### Time taken to reach equilibrium

- Decreases

### Concentration of a reacting substance increased

#### Position of equilibrium

- Moves away from the reacting substance in the balanced equation

#### Time taken to reach equilibrium

- Decreases

### Catalyst added

#### Position of equilibrium

- No change

#### Time taken to reach equilibrium

- Decreases
