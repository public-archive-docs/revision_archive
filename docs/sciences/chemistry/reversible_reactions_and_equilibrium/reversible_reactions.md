# Reversible Reactions

## Reaction arrows and reversibility

- An irreversible reaction is where reactants form products and reaction is complete
- A single headed arrow is to show that the reactants turn into products
- These reactions do not reverse
- Common reactions
<br/><br/>
- In a reversible reaction, both the forward and backward reaction can occur under the right conditions
- This type of reaction is symbolised using the double headed arrow
- Can proceed in both directions under right conditions
- Rare occurence

## What is a reversible reaction

- A chemical reaction where the reactants form products that in turn, react together to reform the reactants
- A double headed arrow is used t show that a chemical reaction is reversible

## Observations from hydrated copper sulphate

- Initial state - blue powder, crystal
- Heating       - solid changes from blue to white, steam
- Cooling       - remains white
- Adding water  - white powder becomes blue, heat released

## Observations from ammonia chloride

- Initial state - white powder
- Heating       - white powder disappears, produces colourless gas
- Cooling       - white deposits form in cooler regions of the apparatus
