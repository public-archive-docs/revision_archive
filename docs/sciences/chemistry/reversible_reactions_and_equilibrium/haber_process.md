# Haber Process

- Balanced equation:
	- N<sub>2</sub><sub>(g)</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub><sub>(g)</sub> (reversible) 2NH<sub>3</sub><sub>(g)</sub>
- Reaction is reversible and forms an [equilibrium](./dynamic_equilibrium.md/#dynamic-equilibrium-1) between reactants and products
<br/><br/>
- Ammonia is crucial for the production of fertilisers which support global argiculture
- Its also used in the production of:
	- Explosives
	- Pharmaceuticals
	- Textiles
	- Cleaning products
<br/><br/>
- Raw materials for this process are both gases, and whilst nitrogen can be collected from the air, hydrogen isnt so easy to source
- Feedstock: Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) is currently the most common source of hydrogen
- Natural gas is used because:
	- Abundant
	- Cost effective

## Conditions for the Haber Process

- 450<sup>o</sup>C (temperature)
- 200 atm (pressure)
- Iron (Fe) catalyst
<br/><br/>
- Ammonia is cooled, condensed and collected reguarly
- This pushes the equilibrium towards more ammonia production, maimising yield
