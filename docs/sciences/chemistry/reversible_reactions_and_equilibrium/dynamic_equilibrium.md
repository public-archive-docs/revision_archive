# Dynamic Equilibrium

## Closed system

- Where no matter can leave or enter but energy can be transferred

## Equilibrium

- A state where opposing forces/processes are balanced
	- Mechanical - seesaw balanced
	- Thermal    - two objects at different temperatures that eventually reach the same temp in contact

### Chemical Equilibrium

- Occurs when the forward reaction rate equals the backward reaction rate
- At equilibrium, the amount of reactants and products will remain constant

### Dynamic Equilibrium

- The forward and backward reactions continue to occur, this is dynamic equilibrium
- At a molecular level, reactions are continuously happened, the system is balanced
- No overall change in amount of reactants and products, even though both reactions are ongoing
<br/><br/>
- Dynamic equilibrium can only occur in a [closed system](#closed-system)
- If reactants/products leave the system, equilibrium cannot be maintained
	- Continuous addition/removal of substances disrupts balance
	- Prevents system of reaching the state where reaction rates are equal
