# Making Ammonia in the Lab

## Properties of Ammonia

- Soluble in water and forms ammonium hydroxide
- Alkaline gas classification due to this reaction, because aqueous hydroxide ions are produced
- Considered toxic as hydroxide formed is corrosive and damage cells
- Very reactive and reacts with acids to make salts
<br/><br/>
- Unlike some toxic gases, ammonia has a very pungent smell and instantly recognisable
- Safe handling of ammonia gas in large volumes usually involve a fume cupboard

### Chemical test

- Damp red litmus paper
- When submerged in ammonia gas, it turns blue


## Synthesising Ammonia

- Can be synthesised in the lab by heating a mixture of ammonium salt and an alkali
- Produces ammonia gas with other by-products
- Ammonia being soluble in water, we can add a desiccant to the reaction to stop this from happening

### Method

- Mix two spatulas of ammonium chloride with two spatulas of calcium hydroxide in a beaker
- Hold damp universal indicator paper and damp red and damp blue litmus paper above mixture to observe changes
- Transfer mixture to dry boiling tube and gently warm using a Bunsen burner on a heat resistant mat, collect ammonia gas in a secondary boiling tube mouth facing down
- Submerge the mouth of the boiling tube holding the collected ammonia gas in a beaker of water
- Test the water before and after with universal indicator paper, noting any colour change

### Results

- Ammonia gas:
	- Red litmus - blue
	- Blue litmus - blue
	- Universal indicator - blue/purple
