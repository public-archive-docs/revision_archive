## Formula and Units

- Concentration - amount of substance per unit volume
	- Measured in moldm<sup>-3</sup>
<br/><br/>
- Concentration (c) = amount of solute (n) / volume of solution (v)
	- n can be given in mol or grams
	- v has to be converted to dm<sup>3</sup>
		- 1cm<sup>3</sup> = 0.001dm<sup>3</sup>
		- 1dm<sup>3</sup> = 1000cm<sup>3</sup>
