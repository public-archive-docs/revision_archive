# Preparing Insoluable Salts

## Method

- Measure out 10cm<sup>3</sup> of sliver nitrate solution and pour into a beaker using a measuring cylinder
	- After using the measuring cylinder rinse it out for next use
- Measure out 15cm<sup>3</sup> of sodium chloride solution into the mixture, stir using a glass rod
	- Reaction taking place should be:
		- Sliver Nitrate + Sodium Chloride -> Sodium Nitrate + Sliver Chloride (insoluble)
- Place filter funnel at the mouth of the conical flask
- Fold a piece of filter paper and place it into the filter funnel
	- Add a few drops of water to the funnel so the paper stays in place
- Run the mixture through the filter
- Rinse the beaker with distilled water and pour the washing through the funnel
- After the filtrate has drained through the filter paper, add a little distilled water to wash the precipitate
- Allow water to drain from the paper
- Carefully open out the filter paper and place it by a warm, dark place to dry
