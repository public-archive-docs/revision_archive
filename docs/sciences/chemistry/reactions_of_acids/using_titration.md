# Making Salts using Titration

## Formula

- V<sub>1</sub> x C<sub>1</sub> = V<sub>2</sub> x C<sub>2</sub>
	- V<sub>1</sub> - volume of acid
	- C<sub>1</sub>  - concentration of acid
	- V<sub>2</sub>  - volume of base
	- C<sub>2</sub>  - concentration of base

## Method

- Place a conical flask
- Measure out 25cm<sup>3</sup> of sulphuric acid using a glass pipette
	- Transfer to the conical flask
- Add 3 drops of phenolphthalein to the conical flask
- Place a clamp and position a burette above the conical flask
	- Ensure the valve is closed before adding the sodium hydroxide solution
- When the valve is closed, fill the burette to 0cm<sup>3</sup> with sodium hydroxide solution
- Add 0.5cm<sup>3</sup> of sodium hydroxide
- After the sodium hydroxide is added, swirl the beaker around to mix the contents
	- Measure amount of sodium hydroxide used and record observations in colour change
		- If there is no colour change then repeat the steps
		- If there is a colour change then note down the volume of sodium hydroxide used
			- Repeat the experiment but with smaller increments to get an accurate result
				- Repeat until the data is concordant (within 0.1<sup>3</sup> each other)
- With completed the experiment and the data is concordant, calculate the mean titre (start - end volume)
