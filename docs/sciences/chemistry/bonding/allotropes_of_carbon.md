# Allotropes of Carbon

- Allotrope - made of the same substance but arranged differently

## Diamond

- Carbon atoms forms four covalent bonds
- Rigid covalent structure
- High melting/boiling point as every strong covalent bond must be broken to seperate the atoms, this takes a lot of energy
- Does not conduct electricity as no delocalised electrons


## Graphite

- Carbon atoms forms three covalent bonds
- In layers making a giant covalent structure
- High melting/boiling point as it involves breaking many strong covalent bonds to seperate the atoms
- Between each layer are weak intermolecular forces of attraction
	- Easily broke so the layers can slide over each other, making it soft
- Each carbon atom provides a delocalised electron (due to the 3 bond made)
	- Means graphite can conduct electricity


## Graphene

- Structure resembles a single layer of graphite
- High melting point and very strong due to its large regular arrangement of carbon atoms joined by covalent bonds
- Each carbon atom provides a delocalised electron (single layer of graphite = 3 bonded carbon)
	- Graphene can conduct electricity


## Fullerenes

### Buckyballs

- Spherical form of carbon atoms
- Made of large molecules, not classed as giant covalent structure
- Weak intermolecular forces exist between buckyballs
	- These need little energy to overcome
		- Substances containing buckyballs are slippery and have lower melting points than graphite and diamond

### Nanotubes

- Resembles a layer of graphene rolled into a tube shape
- High tensile strength
	- Strong in tension
		- Resistant to being stretched
- Like graphene, nanotubes are strong and conduct electricity because they have delocalised electrons
