# Ionic Formulae

## What is an ionic compound?

- Atoms are most stable when they have a full outer shell
- They gain a full outer shell by reacting with other atoms
- When a metal reacts with a non-metal, electrons are transferred so that each atom has a full outer shell, usually the metal transfers the electrons
- Atom that loses an electron becomes positively charged
- Atom that gains an electron becomes negatively charged
- Opposite charges attract (electrostatic attraction)
- This type of attraction is an ionic bond and is what holds together ions in compounds
