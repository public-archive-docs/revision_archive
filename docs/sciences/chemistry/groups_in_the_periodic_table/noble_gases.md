# Noble Gases

## Physical Properties

- Colourless
- Low melting/boiling points
- Poor conductors - no delocalised electrons

## Chemical Properties

- Each noble gas has a full outer shell
- This means they do not need to gain or lose electrons when they react
- This makes them stable and unreactive/inert

## Trend

- As you go down the group, the boiling/melting point gets higher
- As you go down the group, the density gets higher

## Uses of Noble Gases

### Helium

- Transport, e.g., balloons
- This is because it is low density and inert

### Neon

- Billboards
- When electricity is ran through it, it will jump a shell and return a release of energy in form of light

### Argon

- Stores materials thats prone to oxidation
- This is because it is denser than air

### Krypton

- Fluorescent lighting
- Greatly unreactive which increases it's lifespan, same function as [neon](#neon)
