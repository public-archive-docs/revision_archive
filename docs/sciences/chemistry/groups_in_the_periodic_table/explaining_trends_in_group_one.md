# Explaining Trends in Group 1

## Increasing Reactivity

- As you go down group 1, the more shells an atom has, the further the outer shell electron is from the nucleus
- This decreases the attraction between the nucleus and the outer shell electron
- This makes it easier to remove the outer shell electron and so the more reactive the alkali metal is
<br/><br/>
- The electrons blocking the outer shell electron is called electron shielding
	- They block the nucleus' attraction by repelling the outer shell electron (negative -> negative = repel)
