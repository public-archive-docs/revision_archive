# Reaction of Halogens

- Halide - compound containing halogen
- Displacement reactions happen when a more reactive elements displaces (takes the place of) the less reactive element of its compound

## Halogen Displacement Practical

### Health and Safety

- Wear eye protection
- Wash off splashes of solutions that contact skin immediately, wipe up other spills
- Do not inhale halogen vapours
- Iodine will stain skin and clothes

### Method

- Add 1-2 drops of distilled water to a column on a spotting tile - this is our control
- Add 1-2 drops of each halide solution to a column of the spotting tile
	- The halide solutions should be:
		- Potassium Chloride
		- Potassium Bromide
		- Potassium Iodide
- Add 1-2 drops of halogen solution to a row of the spotting tile
	- The halogen solution should be:
		- Chlorine water
		- Bromine water
		- Iodine water
- Record each observation

### Predicted results

- It should be chlorine being the most reactive and iodine the least reactive

#### Chlorine Water

- Distilled Water - no effect
- Potassium Chloride - no effect
- Potassium Bromide - displaces bromine, forms potassium chloride, the solution should be pale yellow colour
- Potassium Iodide - displaces iodine, forms potassium chloride, the solution should be a pale yellow colour

#### Bromine Water

- Distilled Water - no effect
- Potassium Chloride - no effect
- Potassium Bromide - no effect, solution should be a pale yellow colour
- Potassium Iodide - displaces iodine, forms potassium bromide, solution should be a light orange colour

#### Iodine Water

- No effect on any substance, should turn all the solutions into a light orange colour
