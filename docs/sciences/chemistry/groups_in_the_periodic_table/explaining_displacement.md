# Explaing Displacement

## Oxidation and Reduction

- Oxidation is the loss of electrons
- Reduction is the gaining of electrons
<br/><br/>
- When an atom gains oxygen, it gives the electrons to oxygen
- When oxygen is taken away from the atom, the electrons are being given back to the atom

## REDOX Reaction

- When reduction and oxidation happen in the same reaction

## Ionic Equation

- A chemical equation showing how postively charged ions join with negatively charged ions to form a compound

### Example

- A balanced equation:
	- Cl<sub>2</sub><sub>(aq)</sub> + 2K<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 2Br<sup>-</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> -> 2K<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 2Cl<sup>-</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + Br<sub>2</sub><sub>(aq)</sub>
<br/><br/>
- Ionic equation:
	- We removed the ions that did not change, in this case, the potassium as it doesn't change charge or amount, it is considered a spectator ion which we remove in the final result
	- Cl<sub>2</sub><sub>(aq)</sub> + 2Br<sup>-</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> -> 2Cl<sup>-</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + Br<sub>2</sub><sub>(aq)</sub>
<br/><br/>
- Half equation:
	- Stole the ionic balanced equation
	- Cl<sub>2</sub><sub>(aq)</sub> + 2e<sup>-</sup> -> 2Cl<sup>-</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> (reduction, chlorine gains electrons)
	- 2Br<sup>-</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> -> Br<sub>2</sub><sub>(aq)</sub> + 2e<sup>-</sup> (oxidisation, bromine lost electrons)
