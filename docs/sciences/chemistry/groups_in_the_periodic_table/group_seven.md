# Group 7

## The Halogens

- Halogens are found in group 7

### Physical Properties

- Chlorine - green gas
- Bromine  - heavy red gas
- Iodine   - Produces a purple gas


## Diatomic Molecules

- Diatomic - consisting of two type of the same atoms
- Halogens are diatomic as they need one electron to form a full shell
- Hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen are diatomic too
- Halogens have low melting point because of weak intermolecular forces between the molecules


## Decreasing Reactivity

- As you go down group 7 in the periodic table, the reactivity of the halogens decrease
- This is because the atoms become larger with more electron shells
- The increased distance reduces the attraction of the nucleus on the incoming electron, making it harder for the halogens to gain an electron and react
- In addition, the more shells of electrons the more shielding there is which decreases the attraction from the nucleus to the electrons
