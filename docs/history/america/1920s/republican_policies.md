# Republican Policies

- Right-wing - an ideology that belives in individual responsibility and limited intervention

## <u>What is a Republican?</u>

- Right-wing political party
- Believes in competition

## <u>Isolationism</u>

- An American policy that promoted the desire to keep out of foreign affairs

### How does this help with the economic boom?

- Kept all the money to themselves
	- Did not have to give to other countries/organisations, e.g., League of Nations (UN today)
- Many goods were produced in America rather than importing goods from elsewhere


## <u>Tax Policy</u>

- In the 1920s, Republicans taxed individuals and businesses as little as possible
- Cut taxes for the rich, for people who would earn over $1 million, tax went from 73% -> 24%

### How does this help with the economic boom?

- People kept more of their own money
	- Spent on more goods therefore helping American businesses/industry


## <u>Laissez-faire</u>

- Left business men alone, allowing them to do their own thing

### How does this help with the economic boom?

- Business men like Henry Ford could:
	- Come up with their own products
	- Set staff conditions
	- Do whatever to make America money without burdens of taxes, rules or regulations


## <u>Tariffs</u>

- Taxes placed on foreigns goods to make them more expensive ($4 cloth made in Britain would cost $5 in America with 25% tariff)
- Republicans introduced several tariffs such as:
	- Emergency Tariff May 1921
		- Increased tax duty on imports by an average of 40%, some increased to 400%
	- Fordney-McCumber Tariff 1922
		- Tariffs on imported goods were now the highest than it ever was

### Downsides

- As there are no foreign competition, some American industries and business did not improve their goods, services or production
- In retaliation, countries imposed high tariffs on America
	- These increased tariffs damaged the global economy
- High prices and taxes meant life remained difficult for people in poverty
