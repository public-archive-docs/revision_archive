# Prohibtion and Organised Crime

- Prohibition     - prevention by law of the manufacturing and sale of alcohol
- Organised Crime - criminal activites that are planned and controlled by groups and carried out of a large scale
- 18th Amendment  - change that established the ban of alcoholic beverages proposed by the US Senate in 1918, in 1920 when Congress passed the Volstead Act, it was enabled
- Volstead Act    - identified the affected liquors and consequences for the law's violation, passed by Congress in 1920
- 21st Amendment  - repealed prohibition

## What was prohibtion and why was it introduced?

- Prohibtion was the US government's attempt to outlaw the production, sale and shipment of alcohol around the country, went into effect on January 16th 1920
- Southern and rural populations believed that prohibtion would reduced the crime associated with growing amount of immigrants living in American cities

## What were the effects of prohibtion?

- As the Volstead Act did not prohibit the consumption of liquor, Americans drank liquor stashed before prohibition
- Numerous Americans sought liquor prescriptions by their physicans as consumption for medicinal use was exempt
- Numerous Americans also went to neighbouring countries to consume alcohol

## How did prohibtion fuel organised crime?

- Illegal production and sale of liquor developed rapidly
- Bootlegging emerged during the 20s and saw alcohol smuggled into the US by criminals
- The black market for alcohol soon fell under the control of gangsters such as:
	- Al Capone
	- Bugs Moran
- Al Capone made millions through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeering" target="_blank">racketeering</a> and by operating thousands of speakeasies and illegaly sold liquor to patrons and helped popularise jazz music
- Under prohibtion laws, personal production wine and cider made from fruits was permitted
- Other indiviudals tried to find alternatives:
	- Distilling industrial alcohol to make them drinkable
		- Forced the government to poison industrial alchohol to make them undrinkable

## Why did prohibtion fail?

- Tens of thousands were poisoned/killed during prohibition after drinking unsuitable alcohol
- Caused a spike of violent crimes such as the St. Valentines massacre of 1929 when several members of Moran's mob were murdered to be suspected by Al Capone's gang
- Felt prohibition was enroaching on their freedom
	- The disillusionment reached an all time high during The Great Depression
		- Led to repeal movement
- First signs of success of the repeal came in 1933 where the Senate passed the Blaine Act to instigate the repeal of the 18th Amendment
	- Followed up by an amendment of the Volstead Act called the Cullen Harrsion Act to permit the production and sale of particular types of liquor
		- A few months later, the 21st amendment was enabled
			- Economy boosted due to alcohol brewing industry back in business
