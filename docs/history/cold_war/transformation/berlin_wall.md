# Berlin Wall

- East German (Soviet) soldiers began building the Berlin Wall
	- Started construction at 13th August 1961 2pm
- Barbed wire then concrete wall
- Lasted 1961-1989
- Spanned through East and West Berlin for 27 miles
- The only checkpoints avaliable for everyone to enter East Berlin was Checkpoint Charlie
<br/><br/>
- The Berlin wall was constructed to:
	- Prevent Germans fleeing to the West
	- Stop crossing between the East and West
	- Prevent voting with their feet (literally), therefore bulit 3.6m high
<br/><br/>
- This left families divided
- Berliners unable to go to work, chaos and confusion insued
- Border control used violence
- Peter Fechter first killed trying to cross the wall
- Roughly 140 people killed for trying to cross the wall
